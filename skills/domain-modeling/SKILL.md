## 跨宿主适配（AgentBase）

本技能在 WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy / DSH 三处共用。文中若出现某一宿主专用的工具名，按当前环境等价替换：

| 文中写法 | 你的环境里应理解为 |
|---|---|
| `Read` | 读取文件（用你所在宿主的读文件工具） |
| `Write` / `Edit` | 写入或修改文件 |
| `Bash` | 执行 shell 命令 |
| `Grep` / `Glob` | 搜索文件内容 / 按模式找文件 |
| `Task` | 起子代理（环境不支持则串行完成） |
| `WebFetch` | 抓取网页 |

技能名同理：当前宿主没有的技能，跳过并在结果中说明，不要假装调用过。

# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline: challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `GLOSSARY.md` for vocabulary is not this skill: that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

## File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── GLOSSARY.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── GLOSSARY.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily: only when you have something to write. If no `GLOSSARY.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `GLOSSARY.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account': do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible. Which is right?"

### Update GLOSSARY.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `GLOSSARY.md` right there. Don't batch these up: capture them as they happen. Use the format in [GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md](./GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md).

`GLOSSARY.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `GLOSSARY.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md).

## CodeBuddy environment notes

Tool mapping for this environment (use these, not Claude Code names):

| Purpose | CodeBuddy tool |
|---|---|
| Load another skill | `use_skill` with `command: "<skill-name>"` |
| Delegate exploration / parallel work | `task` with `subagent_name: "code-explorer"`; multiple named teammates for team mode |
| Ask the user structured questions | `ask_followup_question` |
| Track work | `todo_write` |
| Read / write / edit files | `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `replace_in_file` |
| Search | `search_file`, `search_content`, `list_dir` |
| Shell | `execute_command` (PowerShell on Windows: no `grep`/`cat`/`&&` chaining) |
| Web | `web_search`, `web_fetch` (look them up with `ToolSearch`, then call via `DeferExecuteTool`) |
| Lint / diagnostics | `read_lints` |

- There is no `Task`-style background agent, no `AskUserQuestion`, and no `/clear` or `/compact` command. To free context, start a new session and hand over via the `handoff` skill.
- Project instructions: `CODEBUDDY.md` (or `AGENTS.md` when no `CODEBUDDY.md`). Project rules: `.codebuddy/rules/<name>/RULE.mdc`.
- `gh` / `glab` may not be installed and `git` may be absent. Always probe first with `git --version` / `gh --version`; when unavailable, use the local-markdown tracker (`.scratch/<feature>/issues/`) instead of failing.
- Git-only mechanics (worktrees, integration branches, PR links) degrade to sequential single-branch work when git is unavailable.
- `*.sh` templates in this skill folder are bash. On Windows, port them to PowerShell before use.
