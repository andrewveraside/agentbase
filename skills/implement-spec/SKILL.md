## 跨宿主适配（AgentBase）

本技能在 WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy / DSH 三处共用。文中若出现某一宿主专用的工具名，按当前环境等价替换：

| 文中写法 | 你的环境里应理解为 |
|---|---|
| `Read` | 读取文件（用你所在宿主的读文件工具） |
| `Write` / `Edit` | 写入或修改文件 |
| `Bash` | 执行 shell 命令 |
| `Grep` / `Glob` | 搜索文件内容 / 按模式找文件 |
| `Task` | 起子代理（环境不支持则串行完成） |
| `WebFetch` | 抓取网页 |

技能名同理：当前宿主没有的技能，跳过并在结果中说明，不要假装调用过。
You have been provided a spec. This spec should have tickets associated with it, describing how to implement the spec.

The issue tracker should have been provided to you. If not, tell the user to run `setup-matt-pocock-skills` skill.

The goal is the entire spec implemented on a single **integration branch**, with every ticket resolved the way the issue tracker closes work.

The tickets are not a list of steps. They are a **task graph** with blocking relationships between them. This means there is always a **frontier** of tickets which are ready to be grabbed.

Communication to and from subagents should be sparse. Communicate primarily through **context pointers**: to the spec, tickets, research notes, and previous commits. Don't duplicate information already available via pointers.

**Implementer subagents** should be run in the background where possible for maximum concurrency.

## Steps

0. **Check the tooling first.** Run `git --version`. If git is missing, fall back to sequential execution in the current working tree: no integration branch, no worktrees, no PR. Resolve tickets blockers-first, track them with `todo_write`, and load the `tdd` skill per ticket. Everything below describes the preferred parallel path, not a requirement.

1. Read the spec and tickets to understand the task graph.

2. (optional) Use an **exploration subagent** to conduct any exploration required by the tickets - relevant codebase files or external documentation. Ensure the exploration subagent can save files - it should save its markdown notes in a directory outside the repo, accessible by all future subagents. This lets **implementer subagents** focus on implementation rather than exploration.

3. Create the integration branch. If the issue tracker closes work through PRs, or the user asks for one, open a draft PR after the first merge in step 5 (a branch with no commits ahead of main can't open one), marked as closing the spec and tickets.

4. Use **implementer subagents** to implement each ticket, each in its own worktree on its own branch. Each implementer subagent:
   - confirms its worktree is based on the integration branch before starting, and resets onto it if not;
   - calls the `use_skill` tool with `tdd` to build the ticket;
   - merges the integration branch tip into its own branch before reporting done

5. Once an **implementer subagent** completes, merge its work to the integration branch with a **merger subagent**.

6. If this changes the **frontier** of available tickets, kick off more **implementer subagents** to work on the new tickets. This allows for maximum concurrency.

7. Once all tickets are complete, load the `code-review` skill (`use_skill` with command "code-review") on the integration branch. Fix all issues raised by the code review in a single **implementer subagent**.

8. If a draft PR exists, mark it ready for review. Otherwise, resolve each ticket the way the issue tracker closes work, and report the integration branch.

9. Clean up all **implementer subagent** worktrees.

## CodeBuddy environment notes

Tool mapping for this environment (use these, not Claude Code names):

| Purpose | CodeBuddy tool |
|---|---|
| Load another skill | `use_skill` with `command: "<skill-name>"` |
| Delegate exploration / parallel work | `task` with `subagent_name: "code-explorer"`; multiple named teammates for team mode |
| Ask the user structured questions | `ask_followup_question` |
| Track work | `todo_write` |
| Read / write / edit files | `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `replace_in_file` |
| Search | `search_file`, `search_content`, `list_dir` |
| Shell | `execute_command` (PowerShell on Windows: no `grep`/`cat`/`&&` chaining) |
| Web | `web_search`, `web_fetch` (look them up with `ToolSearch`, then call via `DeferExecuteTool`) |
| Lint / diagnostics | `read_lints` |

- There is no `Task`-style background agent, no `AskUserQuestion`, and no `/clear` or `/compact` command. To free context, start a new session and hand over via the `handoff` skill.
- Project instructions: `CODEBUDDY.md` (or `AGENTS.md` when no `CODEBUDDY.md`). Project rules: `.codebuddy/rules/<name>/RULE.mdc`.
- `gh` / `glab` may not be installed and `git` may be absent. Always probe first with `git --version` / `gh --version`; when unavailable, use the local-markdown tracker (`.scratch/<feature>/issues/`) instead of failing.
- Git-only mechanics (worktrees, integration branches, PR links) degrade to sequential single-branch work when git is unavailable.
- `*.sh` templates in this skill folder are bash. On Windows, port them to PowerShell before use.
