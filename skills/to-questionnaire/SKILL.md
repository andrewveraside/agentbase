## 跨宿主适配（AgentBase）

本技能在 WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy / DSH 三处共用。文中若出现某一宿主专用的工具名，按当前环境等价替换：

| 文中写法 | 你的环境里应理解为 |
|---|---|
| `Read` | 读取文件（用你所在宿主的读文件工具） |
| `Write` / `Edit` | 写入或修改文件 |
| `Bash` | 执行 shell 命令 |
| `Grep` / `Glob` | 搜索文件内容 / 按模式找文件 |
| `Task` | 起子代理（环境不支持则串行完成） |
| `WebFetch` | 抓取网页 |

技能名同理：当前宿主没有的技能，跳过并在结果中说明，不要假装调用过。
Turn something the user can't answer alone into a **questionnaire**: a Markdown document they hand to one person to fill in async, or fill out together over a meeting. The recipient holds knowledge the user lacks; the questionnaire pulls it out of them.

**Grill the send, not the subject.** Interview the user only about the _send_, which they can always answer: who it goes to, and what they need back. The questions in the document then target the **gap** between what the recipient knows and what the user needs.


1. **Who is it going to?** Ask, in one exchange, the recipient's role, expertise, and relationship to the user. This fixes the questionnaire's tone and how much context it must carry. Done when you know who the recipient is and what they know that the user doesn't.

2. **What do you need back?** Ask, in one exchange, the specific decisions or facts the user can't resolve alone and needs from this person. Done when you have a concrete list of what the user must walk away able to do or decide.

3. **Write the questionnaire.** Draft questions aimed at the gap from steps 1–2, following the Document structure below. Write it to `to-questionnaire-<slug>.md` in the current directory (slug from the topic) and report the path. Done when the file exists and every item the user named in step 2 is covered by a question.

## Document structure

Frame the document as a **discovery questionnaire**: the user lacks context, the recipient holds it. Order questions most-important-first, since async means you may only get one pass, and group them under `##` headings by theme once there are more than a handful. Write it using the template below.

<questionnaire-template>

# <Questionnaire title>

**Purpose:** why this questionnaire exists and the decision riding on it.

**From:** <the user>, **To:** <the recipient>, **How your answers will be used:** <where they go>

## Context

One paragraph orienting a recipient who wasn't in the user's head. Enough to answer well, not a page.

## How to answer

Deadline and rough effort. Partial answers and "I don't know" are useful: flag anything you're unsure of rather than skipping it.

## <Theme heading>

One `##` section per theme. Under each, its questions, most-important-first. Every question is one idea, never compound, with an answer stub directly beneath, and a one-line _why this matters_ only where the question could be misread or invite a throwaway answer.

<question-example>
### What load is the system expected to handle at launch?

_Why this matters: it decides whether we provision for burst traffic now or defer it._

>
</question-example>

## Anything else?

A closing catch-all: anything we didn't ask that we should know?

</questionnaire-template>

## CodeBuddy environment notes

Tool mapping for this environment (use these, not Claude Code names):

| Purpose | CodeBuddy tool |
|---|---|
| Load another skill | `use_skill` with `command: "<skill-name>"` |
| Delegate exploration / parallel work | `task` with `subagent_name: "code-explorer"`; multiple named teammates for team mode |
| Ask the user structured questions | `ask_followup_question` |
| Track work | `todo_write` |
| Read / write / edit files | `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `replace_in_file` |
| Search | `search_file`, `search_content`, `list_dir` |
| Shell | `execute_command` (PowerShell on Windows: no `grep`/`cat`/`&&` chaining) |
| Web | `web_search`, `web_fetch` (look them up with `ToolSearch`, then call via `DeferExecuteTool`) |
| Lint / diagnostics | `read_lints` |

- There is no `Task`-style background agent, no `AskUserQuestion`, and no `/clear` or `/compact` command. To free context, start a new session and hand over via the `handoff` skill.
- Project instructions: `CODEBUDDY.md` (or `AGENTS.md` when no `CODEBUDDY.md`). Project rules: `.codebuddy/rules/<name>/RULE.mdc`.
- `gh` / `glab` may not be installed and `git` may be absent. Always probe first with `git --version` / `gh --version`; when unavailable, use the local-markdown tracker (`.scratch/<feature>/issues/`) instead of failing.
- Git-only mechanics (worktrees, integration branches, PR links) degrade to sequential single-branch work when git is unavailable.
- `*.sh` templates in this skill folder are bash. On Windows, port them to PowerShell before use.
